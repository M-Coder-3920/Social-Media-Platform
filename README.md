# Social-Media-Platform

This social media platform has a php posting function that is executed by writing to the index.html file.\
Files can be uploaded by clicking a button in the posting modal. \
The image file is then copied to the web server where it is later available to be permanately displayed on the main page.\
The posts are all created with the same class so that the css styling is applied to each new post.\
Also, when a post is submitted, there is a php redirect to the original html page.\
\
It is still a work in progress as it only has a few main functions listed above.

    This platform is for sharing encouraging posts, and is called "Good News".
    The working version of this website is hosted at the link below.
